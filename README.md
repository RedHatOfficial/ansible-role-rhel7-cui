Ansible remediation role for profile nist-800-171-cui  
Profile Title:  Unclassified Information in Non-federal Information Systems and Organizations (NIST 800-171)  
Profile Description:  
From NIST 800-171, Section 2.2:  
Security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal   
information systems and organizations have a well-defined structure that   
consists of:  
  
(i) a basic security requirements section;  
(ii) a derived security requirements section.  
  
The basic security requirements are obtained from FIPS Publication 200, which  
provides the high-level and fundamental security requirements for federal  
information and information systems. The derived security requirements, which  
supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls  
in NIST Special Publication 800-53.  
  
This profile configures Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to the NIST Special  
Publication 800-53 controls identified for securing Controlled Unclassified  
Information (CUI).  
  
Benchmark ID:  RHEL-7
